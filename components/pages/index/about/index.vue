          I'm Fullstack Developer working mainly in
          <strong>Javascript</strong> and less in <strong>Typescript</strong>.
          My primary frontend framework is <strong>Vue.js</strong>, but I'm also
          able to work with <strong>React.js</strong>. I'm familiar with state
          management libraries - <strong>Vuex</strong> and
          <strong>Redux</strong>. I know <strong>SSR</strong> and frameworks
          which allow to work with it - <strong>Nuxt</strong> and
          <strong>Next</strong>. I'm fluent with <strong>CSS</strong>, tools
          related to it like <strong>SCSS</strong> or
          <strong>TailwindCSS</strong> and UI libraries such as
          <strong>Vuetify</strong> and <strong>Material UI</strong>. I also know
          basics of <strong>3D</strong> rendering in the browsers and
          <strong>Three.js</strong> framework.
        </p>
        <p class="py-2">
          On the backend I use <strong>Node.js</strong> and its frameworks -
          <strong>Express.js</strong>, <strong>Nest.js</strong> and
          <strong>Serverless</strong>. I know relational databases such as
          <strong>MySQL</strong>, <strong>PostgreSQL</strong> and non-relational
          - <strong>MongoDB</strong>. To work with them I use ORMs -
          <strong>Sequelize</strong>, <strong>TypeORM</strong> and ODM -
          <strong>Mongoose</strong>. I use <strong>Jest.js</strong> for testing,
          <strong>Git</strong> for control version, <strong>Swagger</strong> for
          API documentation, <strong>Docker</strong> for containerization and
          <strong>Jenkins</strong> for CD/CI. This is what I can do at the
          moment - however, my priority is to
          <strong>meet a business needs</strong>, so I'm open to learn
          everything which allows me to achieve that.

          I started my profesional career in 2018, when I joined
          <strong>Webwizards</strong> - the agency working for the biggest
          automotive brands like <strong>Audi</strong>,
          <strong>Volkswagen</strong>, <strong>Porsche</strong> and
          <strong>Skoda</strong>. In 2020 I moved to
          <strong>Auroria Diamonds</strong> - one of the leading e-commerce
          jewelers in Poland. I was studing <strong>Computing</strong> at
          <strong> Poznan University of Technology </strong> for 4 years in a
          weekend mode and I graduaded with a
          <strong>Bachelor of Science</strong> degree. I would say my English
          level is <strong>B2/C1</strong>, but I never passed any certification
          which could confirm it. I'm planning to pass
          <strong> Cambridge C1 </strong> in the first quarter of 2022.

          I love programming and I spend time for
          <strong>learning every day</strong>. I would like to work in an
          <strong> international company </strong> where I could
          <strong>mature as a programmer</strong> and become
          <strong> Senior Developer </strong> /
          <strong> Team leader </strong> in the future.
